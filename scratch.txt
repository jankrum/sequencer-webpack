The transporter gets button presses from the user
We want to it send out button presses to the paginator and playbacker
If the button press is a "next" or "previous" button, it should:
    - send the button press to the paginator
If the button press is a "start", "pause", or "stop" button, it should:
    - send the button press to the playbacker

The paginator is in charge of paginating through the setlist
We want to be able to tell it when to go to the previous and next chart
When it goes to a new chart, it should:
    - send the new chart title and pagination info to the transporter
    - send the new chart to the playbacker

The playbacker is in change of playing back the chart
We want to be able to tell it when to start, stop, pause, resume, and use a certain chart
When it starts, it should:
    - send the playbackState to the transporter
When it stops, it should:
    - send the playbackState to the transporter
When it pauses, it should:
    - send the playbackState to the transporter
When it resumes, it should:
    - send the playbackState to the transporter
When it uses a certain chart, it should:
    - stop itself if it is currently playing or paused
